    <b>Note:</b> This update log was originally made for the long gone in-game update log system from around late 2018. Due to it being from the old system it is unlikely that it will ever be given a version number due to the fact that the old system predates the current version numbers system. It is also unlikely that it will ever have a listed exact publish time. More info on this is available in the <a href="https://bobdevstudio.github.io/RBAP-Wiki/Posts/Update-Log-Notes">notes about the update log system</a>.
